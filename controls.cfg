This is the controls config file! This is really picky though so don't mess up.
Left side of equal sign is the command, right side is they key. Don't put spaces anywhere and no quotes or anything either.
For a complete list of available keys, see http://love2d.org/wiki/KeyConstant
You can put more than 1 key for a command by seperating the keys with a ";"
Also yeah this means you can't use ; as a key.
There is no guarantee that this config file will work when altered. If it doesn't, simply delete or restore it.
